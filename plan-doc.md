In this project, I have to build a Lift Simulator

The tech stack to be used is quiet simple: HTML, CSS and JS/TS.

Let discuss about the feature for this application:
1. Have a page where you input the number of floors and lifts from the user
This will be the first page the user will see and this will contain Headline as Lift SImulator and will have two input box where user can input interger on number of lift and floors. and a submit button to start the simulator.

Errors: 1. Throw a alert if user doesn't select both the field and click on start
        2. 

2. After the user submit the inputs and click on submit, generate the floors and lifts as per the response provided.
   
3. Animation for lift movement and door opening and closing simulation






Task:
1. Solve issue with Lift calling
 i. lift is getting diabled after a single call
 ii. 
2. Add event listener to negative floor buttons
3. Disable button feature - Done
4. Add door opening and closing animation to lift
5. Add reset button
6. same button is calling two different lift at same time
7. Make input validation  - Done
